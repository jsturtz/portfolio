Each immediate directory holds the distinct code for one of my projects accomplished over my career. Most of these projects are written in C/C++. 

Only one project is in Python (Learn_Selenium_Python), a few are in Microsoft Macro Assembler (see MASM_Assembly_Programs), and several use outside frameworks like OpenCL/OpenGL. 

I have two websites, the Personal Website (which is not currently hosted) and my Pokemon Website (see www.pokedex.site). Both use node.js and express for the backend, with handlebars and bootstrap for the frontend. My Pokedex website also connects to my mysql database for storing and querying data.
