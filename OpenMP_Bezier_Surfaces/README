To execute, must have openMP supported

The purpose of this project is to compute the volume between two bezier surfaces using openMP with 
different sizes for number of threads and number of nodes to inspect the performance gains as
these quantities vary. See writeup.pdf for an analysis of the results. 

Run testProject2 to compile to see results from running experiment with different values for
number of threads and number of nodes.
