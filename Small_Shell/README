To compile, invoke make:
$ make

To run, 
$ ./smallsh

The executable smallsh is a shell environment. smallsh handles a few pre-defined user commands (exit, cd, 
and status), but otherwise uses fork, exec, and wait/waidpid to create new child processes that ask the 
OS to execute other commands. The shell supports I/O redirection as well as backgrounding and 
foregrounding commands. 

The general syntax follows BASH syntax:
    command [arg1 arg2 ...] [< input_file] [> output_file] [&]

Built-in Commands:
    exit - will exit shell
    status - prints either exit status or terminating signal of last foregrounded process
    cd [path] - change working directory to path
