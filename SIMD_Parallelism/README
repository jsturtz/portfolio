To execute, run make
To execute multiple times with different values, execute runTests.sh

The purpose of this program is to execute the same vectorized array multiplication and reduction by using
both SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) and non-SIMD parallelism. This form of parallelism is made
possible by explicit assembly instructions written in simd.p4.c.

See writeup.pdf for an analysis of the data.
