I added files to unit test specific functions within the provided implementation of dominion. These tests include 
 explicit input partitions to get 100% branch coverage as well as random tests. 

To execute all input-partitioned unit tests, execute 
    $ make unittestresults
And then inspect the contents of unittestresults.out

To execute all random-input unit tests, execute
    $ make randomtestresults
And then inspect the contents of randomtestresults.out
