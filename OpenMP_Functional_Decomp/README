The purpose of this simulation is to use openMP to delegate tasks to thread according to their functionality,
rather than data processing. This is a mere convenience, since each thread can run "concurrently" operating
only on its own functional role. 

The program simuluates changes in an ecosystem and then reports those changes for purpose of analysis.
