This assignment is a toy exercise meant to demonstrate proficiency in C system calls and multi-threading using
the C-89 standard.

First, execute make, which will compile both sturtzj.buildrooms.c and sturtzj.adventure.c producing
the executables buildrooms and adventure. Make will also run buildrooms to produce a directory named
sturtzj.rooms.XXXX. Execute adventure to play the game. 

sturtzj.buildroom.c - The purpose of this C program is to use system calls to create the necessary directory
structure required for sturtzj.adventure.c. The files within this directory will be the name of different
rooms, each with file contents indicating the name of the room, the connections to other rooms, and an 
idenfifer indicating whether this room is the start room, middle room, or end room.

sturtzj.adventure.c - The purpose of this program is to provide a CLI for a user to play a game: the user
begins at the start room, and is then prompted to navigate to any nearby connected room. The file uses 
a system call to change directory, file I/O, and multi-threading with mutex locks.
